## Technology

We use the following technologies to build and enhance the user interface:

- **Tailwind CSS**: For modern and responsive styling.
- **Headless UI**: To implement accessible and unopinionated UI components.

For JavaScript frameworks and web development:

- **React**: A powerful library for building user interfaces.
- **Emotion**: For styling components with CSS-in-JS.
- **Next.js**: As our primary web framework, providing server-side rendering and optimized performance.

## Getting Started

First, build the development server:

```bash
npm run build
```
Then start the server using:
```bash
npm run start
```
If you encounter any errors when building, you can use:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `page.tsx` or `layout.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
